# Gapminder_world_data_analysis
	
Gapminder has collected a lot of information about how people live their lives in different countries, tracked across the years, and on a number of different indicators. 
For this project, I would select some interesting indicators to investigate.

Data is provided as Excel spreadsheet files, which you can acess from the below link:
